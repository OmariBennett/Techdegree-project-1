Random Quote Generator
Random Code Generator
By: Omari Bennett 2/11/18

Requirements:
	Array of objects is named quotes
	Array contains at least 5 quote objects

	Objects in array include quote and source properties. If known, citation and date properties are present
		Objects in array include additional properties, such as categorization tags

Function is named getRandomQuote and returns a random object from the quotes array
	Function named printQuote calls the getRandomQuote function
		Function prints the quote to the page using the template supplied in the project instructions

	Comments are included in the code.

Exceeds Expectations:
	I'm shooting for the "Exceeds Expectations" grade by:
		Add more properties to the quote object. For example, a tags property could include a list of "tags" like "humor", "business", or "politics" to categorize each quote.
	Quotes change automatically after certain amount of time passes
		Background color changes each time the quote changes

Note: I made two printQuote functions; the first one pass a string of HTML to the DOM.
	 The other one builds the HTML tags on to the DOM with JS.
